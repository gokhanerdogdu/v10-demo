For Odoo Version 10.0, this module allows you to create a Meta Group ('Group of Groups') to more efficiently assign users to the Application 
level groups.  

For example, a Meta Group 'Inside Sales' can be created with the relevant Sales, Inventory, Purchasing, Accounting and Helpdesk group permission levels.
  
Assigning permissions to a new Inside Salesperson is as simple as adding them to a single Meta Group - they are added to the predefined groups 
automatically!
